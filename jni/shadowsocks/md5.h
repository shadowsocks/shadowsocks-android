  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321.
  It is derived directly from the text of the RFC and not from the
  reference implementation.

  The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
  <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
	added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
	Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.
