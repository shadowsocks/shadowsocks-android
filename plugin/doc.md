# Overview

Plugin should be bundled as an apk. `$PLUGIN_ID` in this documentation corresponds to the
 executable name for the plugin in order to be cross-platform, e.g. `obfs-local`. An apk can have
 more than one plugins bundled. We don't care as long as they have different `$PLUGIN_ID`. For
 duplicated plugin ID, host should refuse to start.

There are no arbitrary restrictions/requirements on package name, component name and content
 provider authority, but you're suggested to follow the format in this documentations. For package
 name, use `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.$PLUGIN_ID` if it only contains a single plugin to prevent
 duplicated plugins. In some places hyphens are not accepted, for example package name. In that
 case, hyphens `-` should be changed into underscores `_`. For example, the package name for
 `obfs-local` would probably be `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.obfs_local`.

It's advised to use this library for easier development, but you're free to start from scratch following this
 documentation.

# Plugin configuration

Plugins get their args configured via one of the following two options:

* A configuration activity;
  ([example](https://github.com/shadowsocks/simple-obfs-android/tree/4f82c4a4e415d666e70a7e2e60955cb0d85c1615))
* If no configuration activity is found or the activity requests the fallback mode, the fallback
  mode will be used: user manual input and optional help message.
  ([example](https://github.com/shadowsocks/kcptun-android/tree/41f42077e177618553417c16559784a51e9d8c4c))

Your user interface need not be consistent with shadowsocks-android styling - you don't need to use
 preferences UI at all if you don't feel like it - however it's recommended to use Material Design
 at minimum.

## Configuration activity

If the plugin provides a configuration activity, it will be started when user picks your plugin and
 taps configure. It:

* MUST have action: `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_CONFIGURE`;
* MUST have category: `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`;
* MUST be able to receive data URI `plugin://com.github.shadowsocks/$PLUGIN_ID`;
* SHOULD parse string extra `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_OPTIONS` (all options as a single
  string) and display the current options;
* SHOULD distinguish between server settings and feature settings in some way, e.g. for
  `obfs-local`, `obfs` is a server setting and `obfs_host` is a feature setting;
* On finish, it SHOULD return one of the following results:
  - `RESULT_OK = 0`: In this case it MUST return the data Intent with the new
    `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_OPTIONS`;
  - `RESULT_CANCELED = -1`: Nothing will be changed;
  - `RESULT_FALLBACK = 1`: Fallback mode is requested and the host should display the fallback
    editor.

This corresponds to `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ConfigurationActivity` in the plugin library.
 Here's what a proper configuration activity usually should look like in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
        ...
        <activity android:name=".ConfigActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_CONFIGURE"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
                <data android:scheme="plugin"
                      android:host="com.github.shadowsocks"
                      android:path="/$PLUGIN_ID"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## Help activity/callback

If the plugin doesn't provide a configuration activity, it's highly recommended to provide a help
 message in the form of an Activity. It:

* MUST have action: `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_HELP`;
* MUST have category: `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`;
* MUST be able to receive data URI `plugin://com.github.shadowsocks/$PLUGIN_ID`;
* CAN parse string extra `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_OPTIONS` and display some more
  relevant information;
* SHOULD parse `@NightMode` int extra `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_NIGHT_MODE` and act
  accordingly;
* SHOULD either:
  - Be invisible and return help message with CharSequence extra
    `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_HELP_MESSAGE` in the data intent with `RESULT_OK`; (in this
    case, a simple dialog will be shown containing the message)
  - Be visible and return `RESULT_CANCELED`.
* SHOULD distinguish between server settings and feature settings in some way, e.g. for
  `simple_obfs`, `obfs` is a server setting and `obfs_host` is a feature setting.

This corresponds to `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.HelpActivity` or
 `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.HelpCallback` in the plugin library. Here's what a proper help
 activity/callback usually should look like in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
        ...
        <activity android:name=".HelpActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_HELP"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
                <data android:scheme="plugin"
                      android:host="com.github.shadowsocks"
                      android:path="/$PLUGIN_ID"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

# Plugin implementation

Every plugin can be either in native mode or JVM mode.

## Native mode

In native mode, plugins are provided as native executables and `shadowsocks-libev`'s plugin mode
 will be used.

Every native mode plugin MUST have a content provider to provide the native executables (since they
 can exceed 1M which is the limit of Intent size) that:

* MUST have `android:label` and `android:icon`; (may be configured by its parent `application`)
* MUST have an intent filter with action `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_NATIVE_PLUGIN`;
  (used for discovering plugins)
* MUST have meta-data `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.id` with string value `$PLUGIN_ID`;
* MUST have an intent filter with action `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_NATIVE_PLUGIN` and
  data `plugin://com.github.shadowsocks/$PLUGIN_ID`; (used for configuring plugin)
* CAN have meta-data `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.default_config` with string value, default is
  empty;
* MUST implement `query` that returns the file list which MUST include `$PLUGIN_ID` when having
  these as arguments:
  - `uri = "content://$authority_of_your_provider`;
  - `projection = ["path", "mode"]`; (relative path, for example `obfs-local`; file mode, for
    example `755`)
  - `selection = null`;
  - `selectionArgs = null`;
  - `sortOrder = null`;
* MUST implement `openFile` that for files returned in `query`, `openFile` with `mode = "r"` returns
  a valid `ParcelFileDescriptor` for reading. For example, `uri` can be
  `content://com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.kcptun/kcptun`.

This corresponds to `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.NativePluginProvider` in the plugin library.
 Here's what a proper native plugin provider usually should look like in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
        ...
        <provider android:name=".BinaryProvider"
                  android:exported="true"
                  android:authorities="$FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAME_OF_YOUR_CONTENTPROVIDER"
                  tools:ignore="ExportedContentProvider">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_NATIVE_PLUGIN"/>
            </intent-filter>
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.ACTION_NATIVE_PLUGIN"/>
                <data android:scheme="plugin"
                      android:host="com.github.shadowsocks"
                      android:pathPrefix="/$PLUGIN_ID"/>
            </intent-filter>
            <meta-data android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.id"
                       android:value="$PLUGIN_ID"/>
            <meta-data android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.default_config"
                       android:value="dummy=default;plugin=options"/>
        </provider>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## Native mode without binary copying

If your plugin binary executable can run in place, you can support native mode without binary
 copying. To support this mode, your `ContentProvider` must first support native mode with binary
 copying (this will be used if the fast routine fails) and:

* MUST implement `call` that returns absolute path to the entry executable as
  `com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_ENTRY` when having `method = "shadowsocks:getExecutable"`;
  (`com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.EXTRA_OPTIONS` is provided in extras as well just in case you
  need them)

If you don't plan to support this mode, you can just throw `UnsupportedOperationException` when
 being invoked. It will fallback to the slow routine automatically.

## JVM mode

This feature hasn't been implemented yet.

# Plugin security

Plugins are certified using package signatures and shadowsocks-android will consider these
 signatures as trusted:

* Signatures by [trusted sources](/mobile/src/main/java/com/github/shadowsocks/plugin/PluginManager.kt#L39)
  which includes:
  - @madeye, i.e. the signer of the main repo;
  - The main repo doesn't contain any other trusted signatures. Third-party forks should add their
    signatures to this trusted sources if they have plugins signed by them before publishing their
    source code.
* Current package signature, which means:
  - If you get apk from shadowsocks-android releases or Google Play, this means only apk signed by
    @madeye will be recognized as trusted.
  - If you get apk from a third-party fork, all plugins from that developer will get recognized as
    trusted automatically even if its source code isn't available anywhere online.

A warning will be shown for untrusted plugins. No arbitrary restrictions will be applied.

# Plugin platform versioning

In order to be able to identify compatible and incompatible plugins, [Semantic
 Versioning](http://semver.org/) will be used.

>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
>1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
>2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
>3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Plugin app must include this in their application tag: (which should be automatically included if
 you are using our library)

```
<meta-data android:name="com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.version"
           android:value="0.0.2"/>
```

# Android TV

Android TV client does not invoke configuration activities. Therefore your plugins should automatically work with them.
