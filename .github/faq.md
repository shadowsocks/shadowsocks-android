### Why does Shadowsocks consume so much battery on Android 5.0+?

As Shadowsocks takes over the whole device network, any battery used by network activities from other apps are also counted as those from Shadowsocks. So, the battery usage of Shadowsocks equals to the sum of all the network activities of your device. Shadowsocks itself is a totally I/O bound application on modern Android devices, which is expected not to consume any notable battery.

So if you notice a significant increase in battery usage after you use Shadowsocks, it's most likely caused by other apps. For example, Google Play services can consume more battery after being able to connecting to Google, etc.

### It works fine under Wi-Fi but can't connect through cellular data?
