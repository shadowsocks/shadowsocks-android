	Foremost, this release fixes some security problems.
	It contains a fix for a "dangling pointer" bug that could cause pdnsd to
	crash when it received a long reply. It also addresses some of the issues
	raised in the <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113">CERT
	vulnerability note VU#800113</a> by making the default of
	<code>query_port_start</code> equal to 1024, thereby ensuring that source
	ports are randomly selected by the pdnsd resolver in the range 1024-65535.
	This release also fixes problems with compiling pdnsd for the ARM architecture
	and for the Darwin platform (Max OS X).
	<br>
	There are a number of (minor) new features.
	pdnsd now supports "include" files, essentially configuration files that
	only contain definitions for local records.
	It is now possible to define interactively, using <code>pdnsd-ctl</code>,
	any local record that can be defined in a configuration file.

	pdnsd's license has been upgraded to GPL version 3.
	A bug has been fixed which which caused pdnsd to handle NXDOMAIN replies
	inefficiently when configured with <code>neg_domain_pol=on</code>.  The
	code that implements the ping test has been fixed, which was broken for
	64-bit systems.  A new option <code>randomize_servers</code> can be used
	to give each server in a section of the configuration file an equal
	chance of being queried.  The new options <code>reject</code>,
	<code>reject_policy</code> and <code>reject_recursively</code> make it
	possible to check for the presence of certain IP addresses in the
	replies of name servers and to avoid some types of unwanted replies.
	The pdnsd-ctl '<code>add a</code>' and '<code>add aaaa</code>' commands
	now allow multiple IP addresses to be specified for the same name.
	pdnsd's ability to resolve from root servers has been improved.

	With this method a UDP query is tried first and, if the UDP answer is
	truncated, the query is repeated using TCP, which is the behaviour that
	seems to be recommended by the DNS standards. There is a new
	configuration option <code>use_nss</code>, which can be turned off to
	prevent lengthy timeouts and stalls in certain situations. A bug has
	been fixed which could cause pdnsd to crash if debug output was
	generated before the debug output stream was properly initialized.

	exit prematurely (such as ACPI S3 sleep or trying to attach strace to pdnsd).
	Time intervals specified in the configuration file can now be expressed in
	minutes, hours, days and weeks as well as seconds.
	Support for Apple Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger has been improved.
	The "<code>pdnsd-ctl&nbsp;status</code>" command now also provides some
	information about the status of the running threads.

	New feature in this release: the "<code>pdnsd-ctl&nbsp;empty-cache</code>" command can
	be provided with an include/exclude list, allowing the user to specify a
	selection of names to be removed, instead of emptying the cache completely.<br>
	Additional improvements: pdnsd should now remain responsive while executing the
	"<code>pdnsd-ctl&nbsp;empty-cache</code>" command.
	With the <code>query_method=tcp_udp</code> option pdnsd will now also
	try a UDP query after a TCP connection times out, which should allow
	pdnsd to resolve the same names with <code>query_method=tcp_udp</code>
	as with <code>query_method=udp_only</code>, although perhaps with an
	occasional delay.
	"<code>pdnsd-ctl&nbsp;config</code>" or "<code>pdnsd-ctl&nbsp;server</code>"
	commands should now run without delays, even if pdnsd is performing
	<code>ping</code> or <code>query</code> uptests at the time.

	On Linux systems, the configure script will now try to detect automatically whether

	pdnsd is new and improved! Most of the changes effect the internal workings
	of pdnsd, but there also a number of interesting new features (well, I think they are interesting).<br>
	Among the bugs fixed are two rather nasty ones which involve the handling of NXT and NAPTR records
	and which can cause pdnsd to crash or abort.<br>
	The new features include a new server availability test which can be specified with <code>uptest=query</code>,
	support for reading the DNS configuration from resolv.conf files,
	a new option for optimizing the use of root servers,
	a new option that makes defining local records for reverse resolving easier,
	support for defining wildcard records,
	a new pdnsd-ctl command for reloading the config file without restarting pdnsd, and
	a new pdnsd-ctl command for dumping information about the names stored in the cache.
	The documentation has also been updated: there is now a <code>pdnsd.conf</code> man page.<br>

	This version has a rather large number of small changes, which are rather difficult to summarize.
	Among the bugs fixed are a race condition in the cache lookup code, a
	flaw in the code that caused a busy spin when a remote server answered
	with "Not Implemented", and problems with the -4 and -6 command-line
	options. Among the improvements are an alternative sorting algorithm
	which should allow pdnsd to start up faster when reading a large cache
	file from disk, automatic mapping of IPv4 to IPv6 addresses when running
	in IPv6 mode, somewhat more efficient memory use, better compression of
	the replies and changes in the parallel querying algorithm that should
	improve the chances of catching a reply from a remote server.<br>

	The change of version number is not very significant; the
	difference between 1.1.9-par and the previous 1.1.8b1-par8 is marginal.
	However, I felt the need to simplify the numbering, because it was
	becoming rather baroque.<br>

	I've added some missing pieces to the documentation (the pdnsd <a
	href="doc.html">manual</a> and the man page for pdnsd-ctl). BTW, did you
	know that it's possible to define aliases for domain names with pdnsd? I
	had plans to implement such a feature when I discovered that pdnsd
	already supports it. It was just poorly documented. (If want to try this
	for your self, look for the new information about CNAME records under
	the rr Section in the <a href="doc.html#rrsection">manual</a>.)<br> The
	changes to the code consist mostly of optimizations, removal of some
	size limits due to fixed-size buffers, and some cleaning up. I've also

    <h2><a name="aboutpdnsd">About pdnsd</a></h2>
    pdnsd is a  proxy DNS server with permanent caching (the cache contents
    are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope with unreachable
    or down DNS servers (for example in dial-in networking).<br>
    Since version 1.1.0, pdnsd supports negative caching.<br>
    <br>
    It is licensed under the <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> General Public License (<a HREF="../../COPYING">GPL</A><!--notext(-->,
    <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">also available in html</A> and
    <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html#translations">translated into various languages</A>.<!--)notext-->).
    This, in short, means that the sources are distributed togehter with the program, and
    that you are free to modify the sources and redistribute them as long as you
    also license them under the GPL. You do not need to pay anything for pdnsd.
    It also means that there is <b>ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY</b> for pdnsd or any part
    of it. For details, please <a href="../../COPYING">read the GPL</a>.
    <p>
      pdnsd can be used with applications that do DNS lookups, e.g. on startup, and
      can't be configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often minute-long
      hangs (or even crashes) that result from stalled DNS queries. Some Netscape Navigator
      versions for Unix, for example, expose this behaviour.
    </p>
    pdnsd is configurable via a file and supports run-time configuration using the program pdnsd-ctl that comes
    with pdnsd. This allows you to set the status flags of servers that pdnsd knows (to influence which servers
    pdnsd will query), and the addition, deletion and invalidation of DNS records in pdnsd's cache.
    <br>
    Parallel name server queries are supported. This is a technique that allows
    querying several servers at the same time so that very slow or unavailable
    servers will not block the answer for one timeout interval.
    <br>
    Since version 1.0.0, pdnsd has full IPv6 support.
    <p>
      There is also a limited support for local zone records, intended for defining
      1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa. and localhost. , since some clients request that
      information and it must be served even if the cached servers are not available
      or do not serve these records. pdnsd may also read your /etc/hosts file
      (this file is normally used by your local resolver and usually contains
      information for localhost as well as for your machines FQDN) and serve its
      contents.
    </p> <p>
      pdnsd was started on Linux, and has since been ported to FreeBSD (and Cygwin and Darwin).
      90% of the source code should be easily portable to POSIX-
      and BSD-compatible systems, provided that those systems support the POSIX threads (pthreads).
      The rest might need OS-specific rewrites.
    </p><p>
      Currently, pdnsd is only compileable by gcc. This should be easy to fix, but I just
      do not have documentation for other compilers. If you are not able or do not want
      to use gcc, I would recommend you just try to do the minor changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      pdnsd must be started as root in some cases (raw sockets are needed for icmp
      echoes for the option <code>uptest=ping</code>, and the default port is 53, this must be
      &gt;1024 to allow non-root execution). However, pdnsd can be configured to change it's user
      and group id to those of a non-privileged user after opening the sockets needed for this.
    </p> <p>
      The server should support the full standard DNS queries following the rfcs 1034
      and 1035. As of version 1.0.0, the rfc compliance has been improved again, and pdnsd is now
      believed (or hoped?) to be fully rfc-compatible. It completely follows rfc 2181 (except
      for one minor issue in the FreeBSD port, see the <a href="doc.html">documentation</a>).
      It does not support the
      following features, of which most are marked optional, experimental or obsolete
      in these rfcs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Inverse queries
      <li> Status queries
      <li> Completion queries
      <li> Namespaces other than IN (Internet)
      <li> AXFR and IXFR queries (whole zone transfers); since pdnsd does not maintain  zones, that should not violate the standard
    </ul>
    The following record types, that are extensions to the original DNS standard, are supported for caching since version 1.2.9
    (if you do not need most of them, you can disable runtime support for the unneeded ones before compiling pdnsd and save a little cache and executable space, see the source file <code>src/rr_types.in</code>):

    There are FreeBSD and OpenBSD ports available for pdnsd (ports/net/pdnsd for both).
    Thanks go to Roman Shterenzon for the FreeBSD port Sebastian Stark for the OpenBSD one!
    Thanks to Kiyo Kelvin Lee now also runs on the Cygwin platform!
    Thanks goes to Rodney Brown for extending portability to the Darwin (Apple Mac OS X) platform!
    <p>
      If you have questions left, you should take a look into the <a HREF="faq.html">FAQ</a>.

      Bugfixes, patches and compatability fixes for other OSs are very welcome!
    </p>
    <h2>Features in detail</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes some of pdnsds features in detail. Most of the options are set
      in the config file. For more information on the configuration file, see
      <a href="doc.html">the documenation page</a>.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Uptests</h3>
    pdnsd provides several methods to test whether a remote DNS server should be regarded as available
    (so that pdnsd can query it), in
    addition to the obvious &quot;none&quot; test (the server is always regarded as available,
    or availability is set on or off using the <a href="doc.html#pdnsdctl"><code>pdnsd-ctl</code></a> utility).
    These tests are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>ping:</b> a given adress is ping'ed in a given interval. If it there is no response
	  or the host is unreachable, the server is seen to be not available (for those who don't know:
	  pinging is sending a certain Internet packet type to a host to which any standard-conformant
	  host is required to reply).
      <li><b>if:</b> a given network interface is tested whether it is existent, up and running. If
	  it is not, the server is regarded to be not available. This is especially useful for ppp and
	  similar interfaces. A special case test for Linux isdn (ippp*) interfaces is integrated, so that the uptests
	  should also work for these.
      <li><b>dev:</b> this is a variant of the if uptest for use with Linux dial-on-demand ppp interfaces. In addition
	to performing an if-style interface uptest, it also tests whether a specified program (e.g. pppd) owns
	a lock to a given (modem-) device.
      <li><b>exec:</b> a given shell command line is executed and the exit status of the whole command line (which
	  is normally the exit status of the last command) is evaluated. If it is not zero, the server is regarded
	  to be not available. This is a very flexible testing method with which it should be able to perform
	  virtually any needed test.
      <li><b>query:</b> <em>New in version 1.2:</em>
          This works like the ping test, except it sends an (empty) DNS query to the remote server.
	  If the server sends a well-formed response back within the timeout period (except SERVFAIL),
	  it will be regarded as available.
	  This test is useful if a remote server does not respond to ICMP_ECHO requests at all,
	  which unfortunately is quite common these days.
	  In many cases this test will be a more reliable indicator of availability
	  than the ones mentioned above.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Local Records (&quot;Zones&quot;)</h3>
    As mentioned above, there are only very basic local record types (ie the record types that you may use in record
    declarations in your local configuration for records that pdnsd shall serve in addion to the cached ones).
    They are organized roughly in zones but have not complete zone declarations, so I generally do not use the
    term &quot;zone&quot; for them, but rather &quot;local records&quot;.
    These are the local record types pdnsd can understand:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>SOA</b> (information about the name server)
      <li> <b>A</b> (domain-name-to-address mapping)
      <li> <b>PTR</b> (pointer, used normally for address-to-domain-name mapping)
      <li> <b>NS</b> (name server, generated automatically by pdnsd for any local record set)
      <li> <b>CNAME</b> (canonical host name)
      <li> <b>MX</b> (mail exchange for the domain)
      <li> <b>TXT</b> (arbitrary text strings, often used for Sender Policy Framework)
    </ul>
    You can specify these records in the configuration file. <br>
    You may &quot;source&quot; a file in a format like that used in the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, that means
    that pdnsd reads this file, extracts addresses and domain names from it and automatically generates
    A records for name to address mapping, PTR records for address to name mapping and NS records (name
    server specifiation) for each entry in the file.<br>
    Records can also be changed dynamically at run time.<br>
    A script contributed by Marko Stolle makes pdnsd usable in a DHCP setup using this feature.
    <br>
    <h1>System requirements</h1>
    As mentioned, pdnsd currently runs under Linux, FreeBSD and Cygwin.
    Other BSD flavours may or may not work (feedback is very welcome!).
    The system and software requirements under Linux are:
    <ul>
      <li> Kernel version &gt;2.2.0
      <li> glibc version &gt;2.0.1 (aka libc6) with LinuxThreads (normally included)
        or NPTL (Native Posix Thread Library, recommended).<br>
	Due to a bug, pdnsd 0.9.8 does not run with glibc2.1.1. This behaviour was
	fixed in pdnsd 0.9.9.
      <li> For IPv6: glibc&gt;=2.1
    </ul>
    The system requirements under FreeBSD are:
    <ul>
      <li> FreeBSD versions &gt;=2.6 (prior ones may or may not work)
      <li> For IPv6: FreeBSD &gt;=4.0 is recommended (no idea if it runs on prior versions)
    </ul>

    The common software requirements for all supported systems are:
    <ul>
      <li> GCC, preferably egcs-2.* or 3.* (other compilers are currently not supported; the needed patch for another compiler
	should not be difficult, however)
      <li> GNU or BSD make
      <li> the standard commands install, grep, sed, awk, touch and which (along with the REALLY
	standard ones mv, cp, ln, rm, pwd, test, echo, cat, mkdir, chown, chmod, tar). In
	any standard Unix installation, this should be no problem.
      <li> for hacking and building own packages, you might also need gzip, bzip2, perl and rpmbuild
    </ul>
